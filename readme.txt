This template contains the bare basics for making a ghost with YAYA, and little else.

This is version v1.0.2, using YAYATc571-5.
You can check for new versions of YAYA here: https://github.com/ponapalt/yaya-shiori
And you can check for new versions of the base files here: https://github.com/ponapalt/yaya-dic

Put together by Zichqec, but this is just the default files so can I really lay any claim to it? If you want to check for updates or get a clean version of the files, the repo for it is here: https://github.com/Zichqec/minimum_yaya_template

Things I included that you could exclude:

• install.txt (but then the ghost wouldn't be drag-and-drop installable)
• readme.txt (but then you wouldn't have this info)
• seriko.alignmenttodesktop,free in the shell's descript.txt (but then it would be bound to the bottom of the screen)
• seriko.use_self_alpha,1 in the shell's descript.txt (but then I would have to change the surfaces or they'd be invisible, and I don't feel like it. This option makes transparency in the png images be used AS transparency without needing a separate alpha file)
