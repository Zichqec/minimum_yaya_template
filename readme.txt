This template contains the bare basics for making a ghost with YAYA, and little else.

This is version v1.0.0, using YAYATc569-9.
You can check for new versions of YAYA here: https://github.com/ponapalt/yaya-shiori
And you can check for new versions of the system files (or pick up yaya_optional.dic for extra system functions) here: https://github.com/ponapalt/yaya-dic

Put together by Zichqec, but really this is just the default files so can I really lay any claim to it? But I suppose if you want to check for updates/download a clean version, they'll probably be here: https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/resources
Translations for the yaya_config.txt and system_config.txt provided by Ayaka!


Things I included that you could exclude:

• messagetxt folder (but then you wouldn't get error messages)
• install.txt (but then the ghost wouldn't be drag-and-drop installable)
• readme.txt (but then you wouldn't have this info)
• seriko.alignmenttodesktop,free in the shell's descript.txt (but then it would be bound to the bottom of the screen)
• seriko.use_self_alpha,1 in the shell's descript.txt (but then I would have to change the surfaces or they'd be invisible, and I don't feel like it)
• Commented out lines in system_config.txt for the yaya_optional.dic and yaya_compatible.dic files (in case you decide to add them, you'll have Ayaka's translations)
